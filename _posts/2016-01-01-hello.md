Hello there,

My name is Klajdi Bejko, pronounced like Kly-Dee (rhymes with Heidi) Bay-Co. I was born in beautiful Albania and currently reside in Washington, DC. This is my site/blog about learning to program, but hopefully I'll write about other subjects as well.

A year ago I took a back end web development course at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/education/back-end-web-development). I had dabbled with code before, but it was after that class I was convinced this was for me. For the final project, I built a silly [app](https://github.com/kbejko/shoku) in Ruby on Rails for finding roommates. I learned a lot yet I felt I knew nothing. I was hooked though.

After the class I sort of meandered following others' opinions about learning this or that language or framework and not really getting any where. I don't think I'm in a position to give any advice, but one piece I wish I had known is to stick to one language and learn that really well.

About a month ago, I finally decided to take a leap and quit my job which had nothing to do with coding. I will follow General Assembly's immersive bootcamp [curriculum](https://github.com/ga-dc/wdi6-formerly-curriculum) and hopefully it will help me stay on track.

If you're reading this and find yourself in my position, I say go for it. Just make sure it's something you really want. If you're an employer, you should give someone who has the motivation and willingness to learn but not the experience a chance. I'm convinced you'll get yourself a loyal employee.

I built this [site](https://github.com/kbejko/kbejko.github.io) using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) a static site generator, and it's hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). There are many resources for getting started with Jekyll, but here's one from [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).

I'll leave it with this for now because it's starting to get long. But please don't hesitate to get in touch. I may not know how to help, but I will certainly try.

Best,

Klajdi
