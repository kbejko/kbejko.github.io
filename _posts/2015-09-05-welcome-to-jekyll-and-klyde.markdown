My name is Klajdi. People pronounce it many different ways, but it’s closer to Klyde-ie, rhymes with Heidi. I’m on a journey, if you can call it that, to become a programmer. This is my attempt to build a portfolio page in jekyll while learning jekyll. I will try to write about it as I go along. So in a away, this will document the process for me to look back on, and for anyone interested in learning jekyll. Bear with me as I will make many mistakes.


{% highlight ruby %}
def print_signature(name)
  puts "Sincerely, #{name}"
end
print_signature("Klajdi, Klaj, Clyde, Klyde, Claudia (yes, a substitute teacher once pronounced it that way)")
#=> prints 'Sincerely, 
#=> Klajdi, Klaj, Clyde, Klyde, Claudia (yes, a substitute teacher once pronounced it that way)' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
