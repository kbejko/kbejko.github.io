![Image of Klajdi and Diu]({{.}}/assets/klajdi_diu.jpg)

My name is Klajdi. People pronounce it many different ways, but it's closer to Klyde-ie, rhymes with Heidi. That handsome fellow to my left is my grandpa. He's pretty cool. He loves Fernet and espresso, swearing, and peeing everywhere, and if you understand Albanian, he'll make you laugh. 

I'm on a journey, if you can call it that, to become a programmer. 
This is my attempt to build a portfolio page in jekyll while learning jekyll. I will try to write about it as I go along.
So in a away, this will document the process for me to look back on it, and for anyone interested in jekyll.
Bear with me as I will make many mistakes. 

Sincerely,

Klajdi, Klaj, Clyde, Klyde, Claudia (yes, a substitute teacher once pronounced it that way)
