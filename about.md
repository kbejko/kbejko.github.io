My name is Klajdi. People pronounce it many different ways, but it's closer to Klyde-ie, rhymes with Heidi. 
I'm on a journey, if you can call it that, to become a programmer. 
This is my attempt to build a portfolio page in jekyll while learning jekyll. I will try to write about it as I go along.
So in a away, this will document the process for me to look back on it, and for anyone interested in jekyll.
Bear with me as I will make many mistakes. 

Sincerely,

Klajdi, Klaj, Clyde, Klyde, Claudia (yes, a substitute teacher once pronounced it that way)
