![Image of Klajdi and Diu]({{.}}/assets/klajdi_diu.jpg)

My name is Klajdi. People pronounce it many different ways, but it's closer to Klyde-ie and rhymes with Heidi. That handsome fellow in the hat is my grandpa. He's pretty cool. He loves Fernet and espresso, swearing, and peeing everywhere, and if you understand Albanian, he'll make you laugh.

I'm on a journey, if you can call it that, to become a programmer.
This is my attempt to build a portfolio page using jekyll while learning. I will try to write about it as I go along.
I've found it helps to attempt to explain what you just learned, it reinforces it. So this is more for me, but if in any way it helps you...even better!

Bear with me as I will make many mistakes.

Sincerely,

Klajdi, Klaj, Clyde, Klyde, Claudia (yes, a substitute teacher once pronounced it that way)
