    My name is Klajdi, it rhymes with Heidi! That handsome fella to my right is grandpa Diu. If you speak Albanian and buy him an espresso and a shot of Fernet he will make you laugh.

    About a year ago I decided to stop making excuses and really learn to program. It has been and it still is very challenging but also very rewarding. Among other things, I mean for this site to be personal motivation. I'm hoping it will force me to continue to learn and write about it. Because I find it really helpful, no matter how poorly, to try and explain what it is I just learned.

    The code for this site can be found <a href="https://github.com/kbejko/kbejko.github.io" target="_blank">here</a>. It's built with Jekyll. I <a href="http://klajdibejko.com/journal/how-to-get-started-with-jekyll">wrote</a> a bit about getting started, but for thorough documentation please check out the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">jekyll website</a>. You will find all posts in the journal section, and 'other' is intended for any resources, projects, or people who inspire.

    Feel free to contact me about anything.
