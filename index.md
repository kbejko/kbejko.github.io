Honestly this is purely for selfish reasons, but if somehow it helps anyone on any sort of new endeavor then I'm all for it.

I wrote a bit [here](http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2015/09/05/how-to-get-started-with-jekyll.html) about getting started, but for thorough documentation please check out the [jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com/). You will find all posts in the journal section, and 'other' is intended for any resources, projects, or people who inspire.
